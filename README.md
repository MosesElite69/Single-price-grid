## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

A buncha breaks and spans really worked well.

```html
<span class="price">&dollar;29 <span class="month">per month</span></span
><br />
```

The CSS was just messy, but I'll probably come back another time.

### Continued development

Really struggled to get everything like the example given, but I should've been more focused on getting something I'm ok with. I'm not gonna try to make it exactly like the example next time, but this fine just the way it is.
